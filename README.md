# Primitive Event Store

Repository to check how can I create simple, primitive Event Store.

## What is it based on?

I wrote Event Store based on [Oskar Dudycz's presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaoZdtQSOTo). 

## What technologies are used?

Instead of using .Net environment, like in presentation, I used Java and Spring. Of course Oskar published his solution in C#
in [one of his repositories](https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventStoreInOneHour/tree/main).

## Kudos

Thanks, [Oskar](https://github.com/oskardudycz), for sharing your solution!
